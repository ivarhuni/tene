## Why

A dedicated, visually delightful countdown page to build anticipation for a Tenerife vacation departing June 15, 2026 at 10:00 AM. A personalised static site beats any generic countdown app and gives full creative control over theming and animation.

## What Changes

- New standalone React/TypeScript/Vite website with no impact on existing code
- Flip-clock style countdown displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Bright, sun-drenched color scheme (yellows, oranges, warm whites)
- Animated sunshine / sun-ray effects (rotating rays, glow pulses) using Framer Motion
- Target date hardcoded to June 15, 2026, 10:00:00 (Tenerife local time — Europe/London / WET, UTC+1 in summer)
- Same tech stack as ivarhuni/hypnotize: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + ESLint + Prettier

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `countdown-site`: Single-page React app with an animated flip-clock countdown and sunshine visuals targeting June 15, 2026 10:00 local Tenerife time

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- none -->

## Impact

- New repository / sub-folder with its own `package.json`, `index.html`, `src/`, config files
- No existing code touched
- Deployable as a static site (Vite build → `dist/`)
